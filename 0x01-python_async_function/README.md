# Asynchronous Programming in Python

## Introduction
Asynchronous programming is a form of parallel programming that allows a unit of work to run separately from the main application thread. When the work is complete, it notifies the main thread. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound and high-level structured network code.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
